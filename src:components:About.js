      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! I’m <strong>Dibyadyoti Sarkar</strong>, born and brought up in the vibrant and soulful city of <strong>Agartala, Tripura</strong>, a place that quietly shaped my voice, vision, and values.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my undergraduate degree in <strong>B.Sc. Physics</strong> from <strong>ICFAI University Tripura</strong>, where I first fell in love with the strange beauty of the universe—the patterns, the forces, the particles, the paradoxes. Physics didn’t just teach me to solve equations; it taught me how to look at the world with precision, patience, and poetic wonder.
      </p>
      <p>My academic interests are anchored in the heart of fundamental science. I’m deeply fascinated by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔭 <strong>Particle Physics</strong> — the universe at its most elemental,</li>
        <li>⚛️ <strong>High Energy Physics</strong> — the collisions that reveal our cosmic origins, and</li>
        <li>🌀 <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> — the bizarre, beautiful math that rules the microscopic world.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If life aligns the way I hope, I’ll probably dive into research in one of these fields someday—chasing quarks, quantum fields, or whatever’s hiding behind the curtain of the known.</p>
      <p>
        That said, my mind isn’t a one-lane road. I’m equally drawn to the world of <strong>mathematics</strong>, the logic of <strong>machine learning</strong>, the structure of <strong>economics</strong>, the geopolitics of <strong>international relations</strong>, and the transformative power of <strong>public policy and governance</strong>. I believe that science and society aren’t separate pursuits—they’re two sides of the same pursuit of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not immersed in academia or policy journals, you’ll find me reading non-fiction, watching political satire, getting lost in movies that haunt and heal, or laughing out loud to some sharp stand-up comedy. I also love exploring new tech tools and AI platforms—I'm that guy who signs up for beta testing just for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is my digital workspace, thought journal, and time capsule. It helps me track what I’ve done, what I’m thinking, and what kind of world I want to help build. Some posts might be personal, some analytical, and some purely experimental—but all of it will be me.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve read a book that made you pause or watched a film that messed with your head (in a good way), send it my way. I live for good recommendations, unfiltered thoughts, and raw, meaningful conversations.

      <p>
        Thanks for stopping by. Here’s to curiosity that never sleeps, learning that never ends, and building a life that makes sense in both equations and emotions.
