    <section class="about">
      <p>Hey! I’m Dibyadyoti Sarkar, born and brought up in the vibrant and soulful city of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Agartala" target="_blank">Agartala, Tripura</a>, a place that quietly shaped my voice, vision, and values.</p>

      <p>I completed my undergraduate degree in B.Sc. Physics from ICFAI University Tripura, where I first fell in love with the strange beauty of the universe—the patterns, the forces, the particles, the paradoxes. Physics didn’t just teach me to solve equations; it taught me how to look at the world with precision, patience, and poetic wonder.</p>

      <p>My academic interests are anchored in the heart of fundamental science. I’m deeply fascinated by</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔭 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" target="_blank">Particle Physics</a> — the universe at its most elemental,</li>
        <li>⚛️ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_energy_physics" target="_blank">High Energy Physics</a> — the collisions that reveal our cosmic origins, and</li>
        <li>🌀 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">Quantum Mechanics</a> — the bizarre, beautiful math that rules the microscopic world.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If life aligns the way I hope, I’ll probably dive into research in one of these fields someday—chasing quarks, quantum fields, or whatever’s hiding behind the curtain of the known.</p>

      <p>That said, my mind isn’t a one-lane road. I’m equally drawn to the world of mathematics, the logic of machine learning, the structure of economics, the geopolitics of international relations, and the transformative power of public policy and governance. I believe that science and society aren’t separate pursuits—they’re two sides of the same pursuit of truth.</p>

      <p>When I’m not immersed in academia or policy journals, you’ll find me reading non-fiction, watching political satire, getting lost in movies that haunt and heal, or laughing out loud to some sharp stand-up comedy. I also love exploring new tech tools and AI platforms—I'm that guy who signs up for beta testing just for fun.</p>

      <p>This website is my digital workspace, thought journal, and time capsule. It helps me track what I’ve done, what I’m thinking, and what kind of world I want to help build. Some posts might be personal, some analytical, and some purely experimental—but all of it will be me.</p>

      <p>If you’ve read a book that made you pause or watched a film that messed with your head (in a good way), send it my way. I live for good recommendations, unfiltered thoughts, and raw, meaningful conversations.</p>

      <p>Want to connect, collaborate, or just drop a “hi”? Head over to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page—I’ll be there.</p>

      <p>Thanks for stopping by.<br>
      Here’s to curiosity that never sleeps, learning that never ends, and building a life that makes sense in both equations and emotions.</p>
