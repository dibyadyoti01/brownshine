  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hey there! I’m <strong>Dibyadyoti Sarkar</strong>, born and raised in the soulful city of 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Agartala,+Tripura" target="_blank">Agartala, Tripura</a>, 
    nestled in the lush landscapes of India’s enchanting Northeast. It’s a place where the sun sets early, 
    but the dreams stretch far into the night. The rhythm of this city shaped my curiosity, resilience, 
    and an ever-burning urge to explore.
  </p>

  <p>
    I pursued my undergraduate degree in <strong>B.Sc. Physics (Hons)</strong> from 
    <a href="https://www.iutripura.edu.in/" target="_blank">ICFAI University Tripura</a>, where I first fell in love with the 
    invisible threads of reality—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" target="_blank">particle physics</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a>, and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_physics" target="_blank">high-energy physics</a>. These domains didn’t 
    just challenge me intellectually; they made me question the nature of everything we take for granted—
    mass, motion, time, and truth.
  </p>

  <p>
    But physics is only one star in my personal universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m equally captivated by the power of ideas. I devour 
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction" target="_blank">non-fiction</a> books like they’re popcorn for the 
    brain—economics, history, philosophy, science, and more. I’m a seeker of perspectives, a lover of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate" target="_blank">debates</a>, and a loyal follower of good cinema and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_satire" target="_blank">political satire</a>. From stand-up comedy stages 
    to late-night YouTube rabbit holes, I find joy in wit, irony, and that thin line between laughter and truth.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests also stretch into the worlds of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" target="_blank">economics</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a>, and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a> — tools and 
    theories that are reshaping the world faster than ever. I’m deeply curious about 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations" target="_blank">international relations</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy" target="_blank">public policy</a>, because I believe that science, 
    governance, and society don’t live in silos—they collide, they cooperate, and they co-create the future.

  <p>
    Also, give me a long highway, my <strong>bike</strong>, and a playlist, and I’ll show you what therapy on wheels feels like.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is my digital checkpoint. It’s where I track how far I’ve come and what cool things have happened along the way. 
    Whether it’s a new project, an insightful book, a milestone crossed, or just a moment worth remembering—you’ll find it here.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve got a brilliant <strong>book</strong> or <strong>movie</strong> recommendation, or just something nerdy and 
    thought-provoking to share, I’m all ears. Don’t be shy—

    Let’s learn. Let’s ride. Let’s vibe.
